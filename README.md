# Predicting Stock Price Direction using Support Vector Machines

## Overview

This project aims to predict the direction of stock price movements using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether the price of a stock will go up or down based on historical data. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
